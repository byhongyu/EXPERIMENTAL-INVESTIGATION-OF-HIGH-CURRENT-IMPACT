\subsection{Experimental setup}

Figure \ref{812237}  shows the schematic illustration of the characterization apparatus. A Sorenson DCR-B 2700-watt power supply is used in order the supply the required current to the fiber tows or CFRP laminate. The power supply operates in a constant current mode, in the range 0-100 A, and is controlled by a command signal from the function generator. Due to the limitations of the power line in the laboratory, maximum current can be applied is about 50 A. The current flow, voltage drop and surface temperature of the laminate are monitored and recorded using an A/D converter and in-house developed software written in LabVIEW. The current flow through the CFRP laminate is monitored with current channel of Keithley 2700 multi-meter, utilizing an internal current shunt in the power supply. The voltage drop across the laminate is measured with the voltage channel of Keithley 2700 multi-meter. Resistance of the composite laminate can then be calculated from the measured voltage and current.
