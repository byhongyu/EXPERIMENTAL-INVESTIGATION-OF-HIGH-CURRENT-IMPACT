\section{Electrical characterization of dry fiber tows}
\label{Section:1} 
While this dissertation focuses on the electrical conduction behavior of cured composite laminates, the dry fiber tow systems eliminate the uncertainties introduced by the curing process and make it easy to control the micro-structure parameters such as sizing amount and fiber volume fraction. In this study, an experimental apparatus is designed to investigate the difference in conduction behavior of sized and unsized dry fiber tow systems under high current density (up to 7e4 A/m2). This study serves as a first step towards understanding the role of resin property changes under high current density in the conduction behavior of cured composite laminates.

\subsection{Materials and Preparation}
This study utilized dry fiber tows made from two carbon fiber types: IM7 from Hexcel and T700SC from Toray. The Hexcel IM7 fiber is without sizing, and the Toray T700SC fiber has sizing amount of 1.25\% (by weight). The fibers come in roll form and are cut into desired length. Sizing of fibers are provided by carbon fiber manufacturers and no other surface treatment in done in-house. Properties of the fibers used in the tests are listed in Table 6 1.
